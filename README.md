# twitch-viewer
A viewer bot for twitch.tv

## Why
This application was created in order to provide a little help to the beginner streamers. Having 0 viewers for months is very upsetting so why not give yourself several viewers?  
The application was tested and developed to be used with a small amount of viewers, for which it has a very low CPU usage. Even though it can be used to get much more viewers, it was not intended to do so by the developers.

## How
The application was developed with Python 2.7.10 using the following libraries (installed using pip):
- pip install requests
- pip install json
- pip install livestreamer
Note that json may be included into your python distributive.
To test a packages for availability, type thise commands into console:
- python
- import json
- import requests
- import livestreamer
If everything's fine, proceed.

In order to run the script, you need two things:
- A twitch channel, which name you pass as an argument to this script. For example, if the URL to your page is `twitch.tv/myname`, you should pass just `myname`
- A text file with the name `proxylist.txt` in the script's folder. Each line of which should have the following structure: `ip:port`.

The "viewers" you get only work through proxy.  
The amount of viewers you get equals to the amount of proxies there is in the `proxylist.txt` file.

The application starts working within ~10 seconds, and you will get viewers within a couple minutes (it takes some time for twitch to process the connections).

## Errors

- `Timeout error for IP` - your request was timed out. If it happens multiple time for the same proxy, consider replacing it
- `Connection error for IP` - this is harmless, proxy servers sometimes refuse connections. This may occur frequently. Nothing to worry about.

## Project state

The current state of the project: **on halt**.

When the project was first written, it was working and has been used by some. But it doesn't seem to work anymore, because Twitch is actively fighting these kinds of exploits.  
Unwilling to keep up with Twitch changes, the project has been halted by the developer.

If you are a developer, you are free to fork and modify the project, as well as use its code (according to the current license which can be found in the LICENSE file).

Please refrain from creating new issues. Sorry for inconvinience.
